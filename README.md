#Mood Based Bevrage Recommender


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Phoenix


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Anamika Prince - Jyothi Engineering College
- Member 2: Angel Thomas N - Jyothi Engineering College


### Project Description
The Mood-Based Beverage Recommender is an interactive website that suggests the perfect drink to match your emotions. 
Simply choose your mood, and get visually appealing recommendations with images, details, and recipes. Designed with a sleek, 
user-friendly interface, it makes discovering refreshing beverages fun, personalized, and engaging.



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Choosing a drink can sometimes feel harder than it should, especially when mood affects taste preferences. 
Yet, there is no simple or playful way to connect emotions with drink ideas. This leaves people with either too many options or none that feel “right” for how they feel
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Create a mood-based beverage recommender website where users select their current mood and instantly receive drink suggestions with images,
descriptions, and recipes. This playful, interactive tool makes choosing a drink easier, more fun, and personalized to how the user feels at the moment.
